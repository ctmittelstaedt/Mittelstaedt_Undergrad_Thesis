This repo is for my Honours thesis project on acoustic monitoring of the collared pika in the Yukon.

### **scripts folder**  ####
Contains scripts for: i) creating a pika recognizer; ii) modelling the impact of call quality on recognizer performance; iii) analyzing acoustic signatures of individuals and populations; and iv) determining the impacts of time of day, human presence and weather on pika calling activity.

### **recognizer_outputs folder**  ####
Contains large `.RData` files with recognizer predictions on multiple days' worth of data from study sites. Also contains files produced by the recognizer during training.

### **data folder**  ####
Contains all other data except for audio recordings due to file size limits.

### **figures folder**  ####
Contains figures used in my thesis.
